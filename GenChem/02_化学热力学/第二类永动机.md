These machines are designed to spontaneously convert thermal energy into work without any energy loss. This type of machine would violate the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, which states that entropy (disorder) of a closed system will always increase over time, meaning that 100% efficient energy conversion is impossible.

**Examples:**

- **Maxwell's Demon:** A thought experiment in which a demon selectively allows fast-moving (hot) molecules to pass into one chamber and slow-moving (cold) molecules into another, creating a temperature difference that could theoretically be used to do work, without any input of energy.
- **Heat Engines with 100% Efficiency:** Devices that claim to continuously extract heat from a cooler body and convert it entirely into work, without any other effect, which would defy the principle that some energy must always be lost as waste heat in any real process.
