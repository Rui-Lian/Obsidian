### 1. **Perpetual Motion Machines of the First Kind (Violating the First Law of Thermodynamics)**

These machines are designed to produce more energy than they consume, effectively creating energy out of nothing. This type of perpetual motion machine would violate the **First Law of Thermodynamics**, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.

**Examples:**

- **Overbalanced Wheel:** A wheel that supposedly spins indefinitely due to an unbalanced weight distribution, which causes a constant rotational force.
- **Self-Powered Electrical Generators:** Devices that claim to produce more electrical energy than they consume, often proposed using magnets or other arrangements to generate free energy.
