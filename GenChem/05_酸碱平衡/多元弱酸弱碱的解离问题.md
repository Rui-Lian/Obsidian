To calculate the pH of a weak diprotic acid, we need to consider both dissociation steps of the acid. A diprotic acid, such as carbonic acid (\(\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3\)) or sulfurous acid (\(\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3\)), can donate two protons, and it dissociates in two stages, each with its own dissociation constant.

For this calculation, let's consider a general weak diprotic acid \(\text{H}_2\text{A}\), which dissociates in water according to the following two-step equilibria:

1. **First Dissociation:**
   \[
   \text{H}_2\text{A} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{HA}^-
   \]
   The dissociation constant for this reaction is \(K_{a1}\).

2. **Second Dissociation:**
   \[
   \text{HA}^- \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^{2-}
   \]
   The dissociation constant for this reaction is \(K_{a2}\).

Typically, \(K_{a1}\) is much larger than \(K_{a2}\), meaning the first proton dissociates more readily than the second.

### Calculation Steps

To simplify, we’ll assume that \(K_{a1}\) and \(K_{a2}\) are sufficiently different so that the dissociation from the first step is significantly greater than the second, which is often the case for weak diprotic acids. This allows us to approximate the contribution to \([\text{H}^+]\) from the first dissociation independently from the second.

#### 1. Set Up the Equilibrium Expressions

For a weak diprotic acid, the dissociation constants are defined as:

- **First dissociation:**
  \[
  K_{a1} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{HA}^-]}{[\text{H}_2\text{A}]}
  \]

- **Second dissociation:**
  \[
  K_{a2} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{A}^{2-}]}{[\text{HA}^-]}
  \]

#### 2. Approximations for Initial Calculations

Assume the initial concentration of \(\text{H}_2\text{A}\) is \(C_a\), and let \(x\) be the concentration of \(\text{H}^+\) formed from the first dissociation. Because \(\text{H}_2\text{A}\) is a weak acid, it only partially dissociates, so we have:

\[
[\text{H}_2\text{A}] \approx C_a - x \approx C_a
\]
\[
[\text{HA}^-] \approx x
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx x
\]

Substitute these into the \(K_{a1}\) expression:

\[
K_{a1} = \frac{x^2}{C_a}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \sqrt{K_{a1} \cdot C_a}
\]

#### 3. Contribution from the Second Dissociation

Let’s denote the additional amount of \([\text{H}^+]\) from the second dissociation as \(y\). The equilibrium concentration of \([\text{HA}^-]\) after the first dissociation is approximately \(x\). After the second dissociation, the concentration of \([\text{HA}^-]\) decreases by \(y\), and \([\text{A}^{2-}]\) and additional \([\text{H}^+]\) each increase by \(y\).

Thus, for the second dissociation:

\[
K_{a2} = \frac{y(x + y)}{x - y}
\]

However, since \(K_{a2} \ll K_{a1}\), the contribution of \(y\) to the overall \([\text{H}^+]\) is very small compared to \(x\). Therefore, \(x + y \approx x\) and \(x - y \approx x\). This approximation simplifies the expression:

\[
K_{a2} \approx \frac{y \cdot x}{x} = y
\]

Thus, \(y = K_{a2}\).

#### 4. Total \([\text{H}^+]\) Concentration

The total concentration of \([\text{H}^+]\) is the sum of contributions from both dissociations:

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx x + y = \sqrt{K_{a1} \cdot C_a} + K_{a2}
\]

### Example Calculation

Let's assume we have a 0.1 M solution of a hypothetical weak diprotic acid with the following dissociation constants:
- \(K_{a1} = 1.0 \times 10^{-3}\)
- \(K_{a2} = 1.0 \times 10^{-6}\)

**Step 1: Calculate \([\text{H}^+]\) from the first dissociation:**

\[
x = \sqrt{K_{a1} \cdot C_a} = \sqrt{(1.0 \times 10^{-3})(0.1)}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.0 \times 10^{-4}} = 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate \([\text{H}^+]\) from the second dissociation:**

Since \(K_{a2} = 1.0 \times 10^{-6}\) is much smaller, this will add only a small amount:

\[
y = K_{a2} = 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate total \([\text{H}^+]\):**

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx x + y = (1.0 \times 10^{-2}) + (1.0 \times 10^{-6})
\]

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} + 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \approx 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
\]

Since \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\) is negligible compared to \(1.0 \times 10^{-2}\), we can approximate:

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the pH:**

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+] = -\log(1.0 \times 10^{-2})
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 2
\]

### Conclusion

The pH of a 0.1 M solution of a weak diprotic acid, with \(K_{a1} = 1.0 \times 10^{-3}\) and \(K_{a2} = 1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), is approximately **2**. This shows that the first dissociation largely determines the pH for weak diprotic acids when \(K_{a1} \gg K_{a2}\).

## 碳酸的例子

Let's calculate the pH of a solution of carbonic acid (\(\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3\)), a common weak diprotic acid. Carbonic acid dissociates in water in two steps:

1. **First dissociation:**
   \[
   \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{HCO}_3^-
   \]
   The dissociation constant for this reaction is \(K_{a1}\).

2. **Second dissociation:**
   \[
   \text{HCO}_3^- \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{CO}_3^{2-}
   \]
   The dissociation constant for this reaction is \(K_{a2}\).

The values of these dissociation constants at 25°C are:

- \(K_{a1} = 4.3 \times 10^{-7}\)
- \(K_{a2} = 4.8 \times 10^{-11}\)

Given these constants, the first dissociation is much stronger than the second, allowing us to simplify the calculations.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

Let’s assume a 0.1 M solution of carbonic acid and calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions \([\text{H}^+]\) and the pH of the solution.

#### 1. First Dissociation

For the first dissociation of carbonic acid:

\[
K_{a1} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]}
\]

Define:
- Initial concentration of \(\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3\): \(C_a = 0.1\) M
- Change in concentration due to dissociation: \(x\)

At equilibrium:
- \([\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]\) = \(C_a - x \approx C_a\) (since \(x \ll C_a\))
- \([\text{H}^+]\) = \(x\)
- \([\text{HCO}_3^-]\) = \(x\)

The \(K_{a1}\) expression simplifies to:

\[
K_{a1} = \frac{x \cdot x}{C_a} = \frac{x^2}{C_a}
\]

Solving for \(x\) (which represents \([\text{H}^+]\) from the first dissociation):

\[
x = \sqrt{K_{a1} \cdot C_a}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
x = \sqrt{(4.3 \times 10^{-7}) \times (0.1)}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4.3 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

\[
x = 6.56 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
\]

#### 2. Second Dissociation

For the second dissociation:

\[
K_{a2} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{CO}_3^{2-}]}{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}
\]

From the first dissociation, we have \([\text{HCO}_3^-] \approx x = 6.56 \times 10^{-4}\) M.

The concentration change due to the second dissociation will be \(y\), so at equilibrium:

- \([\text{HCO}_3^-] = x - y \approx x\) (because \(y \ll x\))
- \([\text{CO}_3^{2-}] = y\)
- Additional \([\text{H}^+]\) due to second dissociation = \(y\)

Thus, the \(K_{a2}\) expression simplifies to:

\[
K_{a2} = \frac{y \cdot (x + y)}{x - y} \approx \frac{y \cdot x}{x} = y
\]

Since \(y = K_{a2}\):

\[
y = K_{a2} = 4.8 \times 10^{-11}
\]

#### 3. Total \([\text{H}^+]\) Concentration

The total concentration of hydrogen ions is:

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx x + y = 6.56 \times 10^{-4} + 4.8 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Since \(4.8 \times 10^{-11}\) is negligible compared to \(6.56 \times 10^{-4}\), the total \([\text{H}^+]\) is approximately:

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
\]

#### 4. Calculate the pH

Finally, calculate the pH of the solution:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+]
\]

\[
\text{pH} = -\log(6.56 \times 10^{-4})
\]

Calculating the logarithm:

\[
\text{pH} \approx 3.18
\]

### Conclusion

The pH of a 0.1 M solution of carbonic acid is approximately **3.18**. This pH reflects the weak acidic nature of carbonic acid, predominantly influenced by the first dissociation, as the second dissociation contributes minimally to the total \([\text{H}^+]\) due to its much smaller \(K_{a2}\).
