To calculate the concentration of protons (hydrogen ions, \(\text{H}^+\)) in a solution of a weak monoprotic acid like acetic acid (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}\)), we need to consider the acid dissociation equilibrium and the acid dissociation constant (\(K_a\)).

### Acetic Acid Ionization

Acetic acid (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}\)) is a weak acid, meaning it does not completely dissociate in water. The dissociation of acetic acid in water can be represented by the following equilibrium equation:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} (aq) \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ (aq) + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- (aq)
\]

### Acid Dissociation Constant (\(K_a\))

The acid dissociation constant (\(K_a\)) for acetic acid is a measure of the strength of the acid in solution, indicating how much of the acetic acid dissociates into hydrogen ions (\(\text{H}^+\)) and acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). For acetic acid, the \(K_a\) value at 25°C is approximately:

\[
K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}
\]

### Setting Up the Expression

Let’s define:

- **\(C_a\)**: Initial concentration of acetic acid before dissociation (in mol/L).
- **\(\text{H}^+\)**: Concentration of hydrogen ions after dissociation.
- **\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)**: Concentration of acetate ions after dissociation.

At equilibrium, the concentration changes can be expressed as:

- Initial concentration of \(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}\): \(C_a\)
- Change in concentration of \(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}\) due to dissociation: \(-x\)
- Change in concentration of \(\text{H}^+\) and \(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\): \(+x\)

Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = C_a - x
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = x
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = x
\]

The expression for the \(K_a\) of acetic acid is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_a = \frac{x \cdot x}{C_a - x} = \frac{x^2}{C_a - x}
\]

### Solving for \(x\)

Given the weak nature of acetic acid, typically \(x\) is small compared to \(C_a\), allowing us to simplify \(C_a - x \approx C_a\). This approximation is valid when \(x \ll C_a\), which is often true for weak acids in dilute solutions.

Thus, the \(K_a\) expression simplifies to:

\[
K_a \approx \frac{x^2}{C_a}
\]

Solving for \(x\) (which represents \([\text{H}^+]\)):

\[
x = \sqrt{K_a \cdot C_a}
\]

### Example Calculation

Let’s calculate \([\text{H}^+]\) for a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid.

Given:
- \(K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}\)
- \(C_a = 0.1 \, \text{M}\)

Substitute these values into the equation:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = x = \sqrt{(1.8 \times 10^{-5}) \times (0.1)}
\]

\[
[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt{1.8 \times 10^{-6}}
\]

\[
[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt{1.8} \times 10^{-3}
\]

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx 1.34 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

### Conclusion

The concentration of hydrogen ions \([\text{H}^+]\) in a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid is approximately \(1.34 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\). This demonstrates the weak nature of acetic acid, as only a small fraction of the acid molecules dissociate in solution.
