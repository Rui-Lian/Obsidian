Let's consider a common redox reaction involving the reduction of quinone (Q) to hydroquinone (QH\(_2\)). This reaction can occur in different pH environments, which affects the electrode potential due to the involvement of protons (H\(^+\)) in the reaction.

### The Redox Reaction
The redox reaction is:

\[
\text{Q} + 2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{QH}_2
\]

### Nernst Equation for the Reaction
The Nernst equation for this redox reaction is:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \frac{[\text{QH}_2]}{[\text{Q}][H^+]^2}
\]

At standard temperature (298 K), it simplifies to:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{2} \log \left(\frac{[\text{QH}_2]}{[\text{Q}][H^+]^2}\right)
\]

This equation shows how the cell potential depends on the concentrations of the reactants and products, as well as the proton concentration (\([H^+]\)), which is directly related to pH.

### Example: Redox Potential at Different pH Values

#### 1. **At pH 1:**
- **Conditions:**
  - \(\text{pH} = 1\), so \([H^+] = 10^{-1} \text{ M}\).
  - Assume \([\text{QH}_2] = [\text{Q}] = 1 \text{ M}\) for simplicity.
- **Substituting into the Nernst equation:**
  \[
  E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{2} \log \left(\frac{1}{1 \times (10^{-1})^2}\right)
  \]
  \[
  E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{2} \log \left(10^2\right)
  \]
  \[
  E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{2} \times 2
  \]
  \[
  E = E^\circ - 0.0591 \text{ V}
  \]

#### 2. **At pH 7:**
- **Conditions:**
  - \(\text{pH} = 7\), so \([H^+] = 10^{-7} \text{ M}\).
  - Again, assume \([\text{QH}_2] = [\text{Q}] = 1 \text{ M}\).
- **Substituting into the Nernst equation:**
  \[
  E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{2} \log \left(\frac{1}{1 \times (10^{-7})^2}\right)
  \]
  \[
  E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{2} \log \left(10^{14}\right)
  \]
  \[
  E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{2} \times 14
  \]
  \[
  E = E^\circ - 0.4137 \text{ V}
  \]

### Explanation:
- **At pH 1**, the redox potential is slightly lower than the standard electrode potential, \(E^\circ\), because the concentration of protons is relatively high, making the reduction of Q to QH\(_2\) more favorable.
  
- **At pH 7**, the redox potential drops significantly compared to pH 1. The much lower concentration of protons (\([H^+] = 10^{-7} \text{ M}\)) means that the reaction is less favorable, requiring a more negative potential to drive the reduction.

This example illustrates how the redox potential of a reaction can change with pH, even when the reactants (quinone and hydroquinone in this case) remain the same. The Nernst equation quantifies this shift by showing how the electrode potential depends on the proton concentration, which varies with pH.
