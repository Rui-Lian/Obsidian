A concentration cell is a type of electrochemical cell where the two half-cells have the same components but different concentrations of the electrolyte. The potential difference (voltage) generated by the concentration cell is due to the difference in concentration of the ions in the two half-cells. This type of cell operates until the concentrations equalize, at which point the cell potential becomes zero.

### Mechanism of Concentration Cell Using the Nernst Equation

1. **Cell Setup**:
   - Consider a simple concentration cell composed of two half-cells containing the same metal electrode (say copper) immersed in solutions of its ions (say \( \text{Cu}^{2+} \)) but at different concentrations.
   - The half-cell with the higher concentration of \( \text{Cu}^{2+} \) is the cathode, and the half-cell with the lower concentration is the anode.

2. **Cell Reaction**:
   - At the anode (low concentration), oxidation occurs: \( \text{Cu (s)} \rightarrow \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \).
   - At the cathode (high concentration), reduction occurs: \( \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu (s)} \).
   - Overall, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode, and the \( \text{Cu}^{2+} \) ions flow from the high concentration side to the low concentration side to balance the charge.

3. **Nernst Equation**:
   The Nernst Equation is used to calculate the cell potential at non-standard conditions (i.e., concentrations other than 1 M):
   \[
   E_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q
   \]
   where:
   - \( E_{\text{cell}} \) is the cell potential,
   - \( E^\circ_{\text{cell}} \) is the standard cell potential (which is zero for a concentration cell since both half-cells have the same electrode),
   - \( R \) is the universal gas constant (\( 8.314 \, \text{J/molÂ·K} \)),
   - \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
   - \( n \) is the number of moles of electrons transferred (for \( \text{Cu}^{2+} \), \( n = 2 \)),
   - \( F \) is the Faraday constant (\( 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \)),
   - \( Q \) is the reaction quotient.

4. **Applying Nernst Equation to the Concentration Cell**:
   - The standard cell potential \( E^\circ_{\text{cell}} \) is zero because the electrodes and the reactions are the same.
   - The reaction quotient \( Q \) is the ratio of the ion concentrations in the two half-cells: 
     \[
     Q = \frac{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{anode}}}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{cathode}}}
     \]
   - Substituting into the Nernst Equation:
     \[
     E_{\text{cell}} = 0 - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \left( \frac{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{anode}}}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{cathode}}} \right)
     \]
     Since \( [\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{anode}} < [\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{cathode}} \), \( Q < 1 \), and \( \ln(Q) \) is negative, making \( E_{\text{cell}} \) positive.

5. **Final Cell Potential**:
   The cell potential can be simplified to:
   \[
   E_{\text{cell}} = \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \left( \frac{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{cathode}}}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{anode}}} \right)
   \]
   This equation shows that the cell potential depends on the ratio of the concentrations of the ions in the two half-cells. The greater the concentration difference, the higher the cell potential.

### Example Calculation:
For a cell operating at room temperature (298 K), the equation can be further simplified:
\[
E_{\text{cell}} = \frac{0.0592 \, \text{V}}{n} \log \left( \frac{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{cathode}}}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{anode}}} \right)
\]
This equation is commonly used to calculate the cell potential in concentration cells.

### Conclusion:
The concentration cell generates voltage due to the difference in ion concentration between the two half-cells. The Nernst equation allows us to calculate this potential, which is directly related to the ratio of the ion concentrations. As the concentrations equalize over time, the cell potential drops to zero.
