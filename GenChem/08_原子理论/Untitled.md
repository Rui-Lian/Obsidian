The development of atomic theory spans centuries, beginning in ancient Greece and evolving through modern science. Here's a timeline of key milestones:

### **Ancient Period**
- **5th Century BCE – Democritus**: Ancient Greek philosopher Democritus, along with his mentor Leucippus, proposed that everything is composed of indivisible particles called "atomos" (Greek for indivisible). This idea was purely philosophical, with no experimental basis.

### **17th Century – Modern Scientific Beginnings**
- **1661 – Robert Boyle**: In his book *The Sceptical Chymist*, Boyle rejected the classical four-element theory and introduced the concept that matter is composed of various fundamental particles.
  
### **18th Century – Early Chemical Foundations**
- **1789 – Antoine Lavoisier**: Lavoisier established the Law of Conservation of Mass, which laid the groundwork for understanding chemical reactions as rearrangements of atoms.
  
### **Early 19th Century – The Birth of Atomic Chemistry**
- **1803 – John Dalton**: Dalton formulated the first modern atomic theory based on experimental evidence. He proposed that atoms are indivisible particles of matter, specific to each element, and combine in fixed ratios to form compounds.
  
- **1811 – Amedeo Avogadro**: Avogadro hypothesized that equal volumes of gases contain the same number of molecules (Avogadro's law). He distinguished between atoms and molecules.

### **Late 19th Century – Discovery of Subatomic Particles**
- **1897 – J.J. Thomson**: Discovered the electron through cathode ray experiments, proving that atoms were not indivisible. This led to the "plum pudding" model of the atom, where negatively charged electrons were embedded in a positively charged "pudding."

- **1900 – Max Planck**: Introduced the concept of quantized energy levels with his quantum theory, which would later be essential for understanding atomic behavior.
  
### **Early 20th Century – Development of the Nuclear Atom**
- **1909 – Ernest Rutherford**: In the famous gold foil experiment, Rutherford demonstrated that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus, around which electrons orbit. This led to the nuclear model of the atom.
  
- **1913 – Niels Bohr**: Expanded on Rutherford’s model, proposing that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed energy levels, and introduced the concept of quantum jumps between these levels. This became the Bohr model of the atom.

- **1924 – Louis de Broglie**: Proposed that particles, like electrons, have wave-like properties, introducing wave-particle duality.

### **Mid-20th Century – Quantum Mechanics and Beyond**
- **1926 – Erwin Schrödinger**: Developed the Schrödinger equation, which describes the behavior of electrons in atoms as waves rather than fixed orbits. This quantum mechanical model replaced Bohr’s model.

- **1927 – Werner Heisenberg**: Formulated the Uncertainty Principle, stating that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of an electron.

- **1932 – James Chadwick**: Discovered the neutron, which, along with protons, made up the atomic nucleus. This completed the basic structure of the atom as we know it today.

### **Mid to Late 20th Century – Development of the Standard Model**
- **1940s–1960s – Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: Pioneered by Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and others, QED explains the interaction of electrons and photons, fundamental particles within atoms.

- **1960s–1970s – Quarks**: Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed the quark model, where protons and neutrons are composed of even smaller particles called quarks.

- **1970s–Present – Standard Model of Particle Physics**: Developed over several decades, the Standard Model describes the fundamental particles (quarks, leptons, bosons) and forces that make up the universe, including atoms. It remains the most complete theory of atomic and subatomic particles.

### **21st Century – Ongoing Research**
- **2000s–Present**: Research in atomic theory now focuses on particle physics, quantum mechanics, and the Higgs boson discovery in 2012. Work continues in quantum field theory and beyond the Standard Model in attempts to unify gravity with quantum mechanics.

This progression from the idea of indivisible atoms to the discovery of subatomic particles and quantum mechanics illustrates the ever-evolving nature of atomic theory.
