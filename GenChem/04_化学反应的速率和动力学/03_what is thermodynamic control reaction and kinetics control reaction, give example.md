Under kinetic control, the product that forms is the one produced via the pathway with the lowest activation energy, making it the fastest to form under specific conditions like low temperatures or short reaction times. Under thermodynamic control, the product that forms is the most stable at equilibrium, characterized by having the lowest Gibbs free energy, and this is typically favored under conditions that allow the reaction to reach equilibrium, such as higher temperatures or longer reaction times.
