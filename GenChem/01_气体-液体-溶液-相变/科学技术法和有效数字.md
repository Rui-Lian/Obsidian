0: 
- 小数：左边的0不是有效数字：
- 整数：没有小数点的整数，末尾的0不是有效数字

非0:
- 都是有效数字

具体规则如下：

## 1. Non-zero digits are significant
- **Example**: The number **123.45** has **five significant figures** because all digits are non-zero.

## 2. Zeros between non-zero digits are significant
- **Example**: The number **1002** has **four significant figures**. The zero is significant because it is between the non-zero digits 1 and 2.

## 3. Leading zeros are not significant
- **Example**: The number **0.00456** has **three significant figures**. The leading zeros (0.00) are not counted as significant figures.

## 4. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal are significant
- **Example**: The number **45.600** has **five significant figures**. The trailing zeros after the decimal indicate precision.

## 5. Trailing zeros in a whole number with a decimal shown are significant
- **Example**: The number **1500.** has **four significant figures**. The decimal point shows that the trailing zeros are significant.

## 6. Trailing zeros in a whole number without a decimal are not significant
- **Example**: The number **1500** has **two significant figures**. The trailing zeros are not counted because there is no decimal point.

## 7. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures
- **Example**: The number **30** (counting people) has an **infinite number of significant figures** because it is an exact count.

These rules help ensure that measurements and calculations reflect the appropriate level of precision.

有效数字的运算规则——粗细计算取粗不取细。

对数、反对数：科学技术法中的10的指数不算有效数字。

具体规则如下：

In mathematical operations involving significant figures, different rules apply for addition and subtraction compared to multiplication and division. Here’s a summary of these rules with examples:

## Addition and Subtraction

1. **Rule**: The result should be rounded to the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the least number of decimal places.

   - **Example**: 
     - Consider the numbers **12.11** (two decimal places) and **1.3** (one decimal place).
     - Calculation: $$12.11 + 1.3 = 13.41$$.
     - Rounded Result: Since **1.3** has the least precision (one decimal place), the result is rounded to **13.4**.

2. **Example with Whole Numbers**:
   - Consider **1500** (no decimal point) and **200** (no decimal point).
   - Calculation: $$1500 + 200 = 1700$$.
   - Rounded Result: Since both numbers are whole numbers with no decimal places, the result should also be reported as **1700**.

## Multiplication and Division

1. **Rule**: The result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the least number of significant figures.

   - **Example**: 
     - Consider the numbers **4.56** (three significant figures) and **1.4** (two significant figures).
     - Calculation: $$4.56 \times 1.4 = 6.384$$.
     - Rounded Result: Since **1.4** has the least number of significant figures (two), the result is rounded to **6.4**.

2. **Example with Division**:
   - Consider **100.0** (four significant figures) divided by **3.2** (two significant figures).
   - Calculation: $$100.0 \div 3.2 = 31.25$$.
   - Rounded Result: Since **3.2** has the least number of significant figures (two), the result is rounded to **31**.

By adhering to these rules, calculations will accurately reflect the precision of the measurements involved.
