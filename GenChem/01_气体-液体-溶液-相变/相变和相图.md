Ice is a solid phase of water, while liquid water and water vapor represent its liquid and gaseous phases, respectively

A phase refers to _a distinct state of matter_ characterized by _specific physical properties and behavior_. 

In the context of physical chemistry and thermodynamics, phases can be solid, liquid, or gas, each with unique molecular arrangements and interactions.

## 相变的发生不仅包括温度还包括压力

氯气在常温下加压可以变成液氯，而氧气在常温下无论怎样加压，也不可能变成液氧——必须降低温度。

1. **The regions** on the diagram represent the conditions under which a single phase is stable[](https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html).
2. **Along the curves**, two phases coexist in equilibrium[](https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html).
3. **At the triple point**, all three phases coexist in equilibrium[](https://inspiritvr.com/phase-diagram-for-water-study-guide/)[](https://byjus.com/chemistry/phase-diagram-of-water/).
4. **Above the critical point**, there is no distinction between the liquid and gas phases, and the substance is called a supercritical fluid[](https://inspiritvr.com/phase-diagram-for-water-study-guide/)[](https://byjus.com/chemistry/phase-diagram-of-water/).
5. **The phase diagram can be used** to determine the physical state of water at a given temperature and pressure[](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/chemistryformajors/chapter/phase-diagrams-2/).

1. At −10°C and 50 kPa, water exists as a solid (ice)[](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/chemistryformajors/chapter/phase-diagrams-2/).
2. At 25°C and 90 kPa, water exists as a liquid[](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/chemistryformajors/chapter/phase-diagrams-2/).
3. At −10°C and 0.3 kPa, water exists as a gas (water vapor)[](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/chemistryformajors/chapter/phase-diagrams-2/).
4. If the pressure is held at 0.3 kPa, water can undergo the phase changes of sublimation (solid to gas) and deposition (gas to solid) as the temperature changes[](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/chemistryformajors/chapter/phase-diagrams-2/).
5. If the pressure is held at 50 kPa, water can undergo the phase changes of freezing (liquid to solid), melting (solid to liquid), and vaporization (liquid to gas) as the temperature changes[](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/chemistryformajors/chapter/phase-diagrams-2/).

## 三相点的特殊性

#三相点

At the triple point, the chemical potentials of all three phases are equal. This means that the free energies per mole of the solid, liquid, and gas phases are identical at this specific temperature and pressure.
