The overall equilibrium constant for a multi-step reaction is the product of the equilibrium constants for each individual step due to the principles of chemical equilibrium and stoichiometry. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why this relationship holds:

## Fundamental Concepts

1. **Equilibrium Constant Definition**: The equilibrium constant $$ K $$ for a reaction is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation. For a general reaction:

   $$
   aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD
   $$

   The equilibrium constant $$ K $$ is given by:

   $$
   K = \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}
   $$

2. **Adding Reactions**: When two or more reactions are added together to form a new overall reaction, the equilibrium constant for the overall reaction can be derived from the individual reactions. If you have reactions with known equilibrium constants $$ K_1 $$ and $$ K_2 $$:

   - Reaction 1: $$ A \rightleftharpoons B $$ with $$ K_1 $$
   - Reaction 2: $$ B \rightleftharpoons C $$ with $$ K_2 $$

   When these reactions are combined:

   $$
   A \rightleftharpoons B \rightleftharpoons C
   $$

   The overall reaction is:

   $$
   A \rightleftharpoons C
   $$

   The equilibrium constant for the overall reaction $$ K $$ is given by:

   $$
   K = K_1 \times K_2
   $$

3. **Stoichiometric Coefficients**: If a reaction is multiplied by a coefficient, the equilibrium constant is raised to the power of that coefficient. For example, if Reaction 1 is multiplied by 2, then:

   $$
   2A \rightleftharpoons 2B \quad \Rightarrow \quad K' = K_1^2
   $$

   This principle applies to each step in a multi-step reaction, ensuring that the overall equilibrium constant reflects the contributions from each individual step.

## Summary of Relationships

- **Multiplying Reactions**: When reactions are added, their equilibrium constants multiply. This is because the concentrations of products and reactants combine multiplicatively.

- **Adjusting Coefficients**: If the coefficients in any step change (either by multiplication or division), the corresponding equilibrium constant adjusts accordingly (raised to the power of the new coefficient).

- **Overall Constant**: Thus, the overall equilibrium constant $$ K $$ for a multi-step reaction is the product of the equilibrium constants for each step, adjusted for any changes in stoichiometry.

This relationship allows chemists to calculate the equilibrium constant for complex reactions using simpler, well-studied reactions as building blocks, facilitating the understanding of reaction dynamics and favorability[1][3][4].
