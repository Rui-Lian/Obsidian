we can assume the contact between wheel and ground is just a point

If we assume the contact between the wheel and the ground is a point (a common simplification in mechanics), the force analysis remains mostly the same but becomes easier to visualize, as all normal and frictional forces act at single points on the ground at the contact points of the front and rear wheels.

### Implications of Point Contact Assumption:
1. **Simplified Force Application**: The normal force and friction force both act at the same point on each wheel (the contact point between the wheel and the ground).
   - For the **front wheel**, the normal force \(N_f\) and friction force \(f_f\) act at the point where the front tire touches the ground.
   - For the **rear wheel**, the normal force \(N_r\) and friction force \(f_r\) act at the point where the rear tire touches the ground.

2. **Normal Forces (Vertical)**: 
   These are the upward forces that balance the weight of the bicycle and rider. As before:
   - \(N_f\) is the normal force on the front wheel.
   - \(N_r\) is the normal force on the rear wheel.
   
   These forces are responsible for supporting the weight, which is shared between the front and rear wheels according to the position of the center of mass.

3. **Frictional Forces (Horizontal)**: 
   Frictional forces act horizontally at the points of contact to resist motion or provide propulsion (on the rear wheel in a typical bicycle). If the bicycle is accelerating or decelerating, the friction forces will help drive the bicycle forward or slow it down.
   - The rear wheel is generally the driven wheel, and friction here plays a major role in propulsion.
   - Friction at the front wheel is often smaller unless braking.

### Balance of Forces and Moments:
To determine the fraction of the weight on each wheel, we still use the concepts of static equilibrium, assuming no angular motion about the wheels.

#### Equilibrium conditions:
1. **Vertical Force Equilibrium**:
   The sum of the vertical forces must equal the total weight \(W\):
   \[
   N_f + N_r = W
   \]

2. **Moment Equilibrium**:
   Taking moments about the front wheel contact point to find \(N_r\) (and similarly for \(N_f\)):
   \[
   W \cdot d_r = N_r \cdot L
   \]
   Solving for \(N_r\):
   \[
   N_r = \frac{W \cdot d_r}{L}
   \]

   Similarly, taking moments about the rear wheel contact point:
   \[
   W \cdot d_f = N_f \cdot L
   \]
   Solving for \(N_f\):
   \[
   N_f = \frac{W \cdot d_f}{L}
   \]

### Fraction of Weight on Each Wheel:
From the above, the fraction of the weight on each wheel is:

- **Front Wheel**:
  \[
  \text{Fraction on front} = \frac{N_f}{W} = \frac{d_r}{L}
  \]

- **Rear Wheel**:
  \[
  \text{Fraction on rear} = \frac{N_r}{W} = \frac{d_f}{L}
  \]

Where:
- \(L\) is the total distance between the wheels (wheelbase).
- \(d_f\) is the distance from the center of mass to the front wheel.
- \(d_r\) is the distance from the center of mass to the rear wheel.

### Summary:
- The assumption of point contact does not change the fundamental analysis of forces but simplifies visualization.
- The distribution of weight (and thus the normal forces) between the front and rear wheels depends on the geometry of the bicycle and the position of the center of mass.
- The frictional forces depend on the normal forces and affect how much traction each wheel has, with the rear wheel typically providing propulsion and the front wheel contributing less to the friction.

the frictional force of the real wheel push the bicycle forward, while the frictional force of the front wheel is an resistance

Yes, that is correct! In a typical bicycle setup, the rear wheel provides the driving force, while the front wheel can create resistance due to friction. Let’s break down the roles of the frictional forces on each wheel:

### 1. **Rear Wheel: Frictional Force Driving the Bicycle Forward**
In most bicycles, the rear wheel is the driven wheel, meaning that when the rider pedals, the force generated by the chain and gears is applied to the rear wheel. This creates a **torque** on the rear wheel, causing it to rotate.

- **Rear Wheel Propulsion**: The **frictional force at the rear wheel** acts to push the ground backward. According to Newton's third law (action-reaction), the ground exerts an equal and opposite force on the wheel, pushing it **forward**. This frictional force is what propels the bicycle forward.
  
  The magnitude of this force depends on the coefficient of friction (\(\mu\)) and the normal force (\(N_r\)) on the rear wheel:
  \[
  f_r = \mu N_r
  \]

  Since \(N_r\) is typically larger than \(N_f\), the rear wheel provides most of the traction needed for forward motion.

### 2. **Front Wheel: Frictional Force as Resistance**
The front wheel typically does not provide propulsion, and if the bicycle is moving forward, its **frictional force resists motion**. This resistance arises because the front wheel contacts the ground and experiences friction, even though it isn’t directly powered by the pedaling force.

- **Front Wheel Resistance**: The **frictional force at the front wheel** acts opposite to the direction of motion. This force resists forward movement, but in normal riding conditions, it is much smaller compared to the driving force from the rear wheel. The magnitude of this force is:
  \[
  f_f = \mu N_f
  \]
  
  Since \(N_f\) is generally smaller than \(N_r\), the resisting force at the front wheel is also smaller.

### 3. **Overall Bicycle Motion**
- The **rear wheel friction** acts to push the bicycle forward.
- The **front wheel friction** provides a smaller resisting force.
- The net forward motion occurs because the propulsive force at the rear wheel outweighs the resisting force at the front wheel.

### 4. **Effect of Braking**
When the rider brakes, especially using a front brake:
- The **front wheel frictional force increases** to resist motion, significantly contributing to deceleration.
- If the rear brake is used, the frictional force at the rear wheel increases, resisting the forward motion.

### Summary:
- **Rear wheel friction** acts in the direction of motion, pushing the bicycle forward and driving it.
- **Front wheel friction** acts in the opposite direction, resisting motion but generally being smaller than the rear wheel’s frictional driving force.


this is a little bit counter-intuitive. because from the angle of an outsider, the two wheels are rotating at same angular speed.

You're absolutely right that the situation can seem counterintuitive at first glance! From an observer's perspective, it appears that both the front and rear wheels are rotating at the same angular speed, so it might seem like they should experience similar frictional forces. However, the key difference lies in **what causes the wheels to rotate** and the nature of the frictional forces acting on them.

Let's unpack this to clarify why the rear wheel pushes the bicycle forward, while the front wheel creates a resistive frictional force, despite both wheels rotating at the same angular speed.

### 1. **Angular Speed and Rotation of the Wheels**
- Both wheels are indeed rotating at the same **angular speed** because the bicycle is moving forward in a steady state, and the wheels cover the same distance over time. The angular speed \(\omega\) for each wheel is related to the linear speed \(v\) of the bicycle and the wheel radius \(r\):
  \[
  \omega = \frac{v}{r}
  \]
  Since the bicycle is rolling without slipping, both the front and rear wheels rotate at the same rate, so their **linear velocities** at the contact point with the ground are equal.

### 2. **Friction: Static vs. Kinetic**
The crucial point here is the distinction between **static friction** and **kinetic friction**, and how these forces act differently on the two wheels:

- **Static Friction**: The wheels of the bicycle are **rolling without slipping**, which means the point of contact between each wheel and the ground is momentarily stationary relative to the ground. This implies that **static friction** is at play, not kinetic friction (which would act if the wheels were sliding across the surface).
  
- **Static friction** is what enables both wheels to rotate while maintaining grip with the ground. It acts in whatever direction is necessary to prevent slipping between the wheel and the ground.

### 3. **Rear Wheel: Driving Force Through Torque**
The rear wheel experiences a **driving force** due to the pedaling action of the rider. When the rider pedals:
- The chain and gears apply a **torque** to the rear wheel.
- This torque tries to rotate the wheel clockwise (if viewed from the rider’s right side), pushing the contact point of the wheel backward against the ground.

Because of static friction, the ground pushes forward on the rear wheel, creating a **frictional force that propels the bicycle forward**. This frictional force is in the forward direction, even though the rear wheel rotates at the same speed as the front wheel.

### 4. **Front Wheel: Passive Rolling**
The front wheel, on the other hand, is **passive**. It is not directly powered by the pedals, and no torque is applied to it from the rider. It simply rolls due to the motion of the bicycle:
- Static friction at the front wheel’s contact point prevents slipping and keeps the wheel rolling.
- Since there is no driving force applied to the front wheel, the frictional force at the front wheel is **resistive**. It opposes any forward sliding of the wheel (which would happen if the wheel started to slip or skid).

Thus, while the front wheel rotates at the same angular speed as the rear wheel, it experiences a **resistive frictional force** because it's passively dragged along by the bicycle’s motion. This resistive force is usually small because the front wheel is only responsible for rolling and not for propelling the bicycle.

### 5. **Comparison of Frictional Forces**
- **Rear Wheel**: The static frictional force pushes the bicycle forward, creating a **positive force** that drives the bicycle. The driving torque applied to the rear wheel generates forward motion through this force.
  
- **Front Wheel**: The static frictional force resists the forward motion, creating a **small opposing force**. However, since the front wheel is not being driven, this frictional force is much smaller than the rear wheel’s driving friction.

### Summary:
- **Same angular speed**: Both wheels rotate at the same rate because the bicycle moves forward without slipping.
- **Different frictional roles**: The rear wheel experiences a forward frictional force because it is driven by a torque, while the front wheel experiences a resistive frictional force since it passively rolls without being powered.
  
Even though the wheels move at the same angular speed, their interactions with the ground through friction are fundamentally different. The rear wheel pushes the bike forward through propulsion, while the front wheel resists motion slightly.


it is static frictional force in both rear and front wheel if we assume point contact between wheel and ground and no slipping

Yes, you're absolutely correct! If we assume **point contact** between the wheels and the ground and no slipping, then the frictional forces acting on both the front and rear wheels are indeed **static frictional forces**.

### Key Points:
- **Point contact**: We assume that the wheels are ideal, touching the ground at a single point.
- **No slipping**: This means the wheels are rolling perfectly, with no sliding at the point of contact. Therefore, **static friction** is the force acting at the contact points, not kinetic friction (which would only occur if the wheels were sliding).

### Static Friction in Both Wheels
- **Rear Wheel**: 
  - The rear wheel is driven by the rider through the pedals, chain, and gears. This applies a **torque** to the rear wheel, causing it to rotate.
  - The **static frictional force** at the point of contact between the rear wheel and the ground prevents the wheel from slipping. This force acts **forward** on the rear wheel, pushing the bicycle forward.
  
  The static friction force is what allows the rear wheel to "push off" the ground and propel the bicycle. Without static friction, the rear wheel would simply spin in place without moving the bike forward.

- **Front Wheel**:
  - The front wheel is not powered by the rider, meaning no torque is applied to it directly.
  - As the bicycle moves forward, the front wheel rolls passively, and the **static frictional force** at the contact point ensures that the wheel rolls without slipping.
  - In this case, the static friction force acts to resist motion, as it opposes any sliding of the front wheel. However, this resistance is much smaller than the driving force at the rear wheel.

### Why Static Friction Works Differently on Each Wheel
Although both wheels experience static friction, the direction and effect of the static frictional force differ due to the roles each wheel plays in the bicycle’s motion:

1. **Rear Wheel (Driven by Torque)**:
   - Static friction opposes the slipping of the rear wheel and provides the necessary force to **propel the bicycle forward**.
   - The direction of static friction is **forward** because it prevents the rear wheel from slipping backward as the torque from pedaling rotates the wheel.

2. **Front Wheel (Passive Rolling)**:
   - Static friction ensures that the front wheel rolls without slipping but is not involved in propulsion.
   - The front wheel’s static friction acts in the **opposite direction** to resist the slight tendency of the wheel to slide forward due to inertia.

### Visualization of Forces:
- **Rear Wheel**: The rear wheel wants to slip backward because of the torque from the pedaling action, so static friction acts **forward** to stop this slipping and push the bike forward.
- **Front Wheel**: The front wheel is passively rolling, and static friction simply ensures it doesn’t slide across the ground. It acts **backward**, resisting the small tendency for the front wheel to slide forward.

### Conclusion:
In both cases, the frictional forces are **static** because there is no slipping at the contact points. The key difference is that the **rear wheel** experiences a forward static friction force due to the torque applied from the pedals, which propels the bike, while the **front wheel** experiences a backward static friction force that resists motion slightly but is primarily responsible for ensuring smooth rolling.

such static frictional force is force of rolling friction

The static frictional force that acts at the contact points of the wheels in a bicycle, ensuring they roll without slipping, is not typically classified as **rolling friction**. Instead, it's called **static friction** because it prevents relative motion (slipping) between the wheel and the ground at the contact point. 

However, **rolling friction** (or **rolling resistance**) is a distinct concept related to energy losses that occur as a wheel rolls, and it's different from the static friction that drives or resists motion. Let's clarify both terms:

### 1. **Static Friction**:
- **Definition**: Static friction is the force that resists the initial movement of two surfaces in contact when there is no relative motion between them.
- **In the case of the bicycle**: Both the front and rear wheels experience **static friction** at the contact points because there is no slipping. This static friction is responsible for:
  - On the **rear wheel**, it prevents the wheel from slipping backward and allows the wheel to push the bicycle forward.
  - On the **front wheel**, it ensures the wheel rolls without slipping but does not contribute to propulsion.
  
- **Key point**: Static friction does not directly cause energy loss but simply ensures that the wheels roll rather than slide.

### 2. **Rolling Friction (Rolling Resistance)**:
- **Definition**: Rolling friction (or rolling resistance) refers to the resistive force that opposes the rolling motion of a wheel, tire, or ball. It arises due to the deformation of the wheel and the surface it rolls on. As the wheel rolls, both the tire and the surface undergo small amounts of deformation, which causes energy loss.
  
- **In the case of the bicycle**: Rolling friction acts on both the front and rear wheels, and it resists the forward motion of the bicycle. It is typically much smaller than kinetic friction (sliding friction) but still contributes to the overall resistance the rider must overcome.

- **Causes of Rolling Friction**:
  - **Deformation of the tire**: As the wheel rolls, the tire squashes slightly at the contact point, and energy is lost as heat.
  - **Deformation of the surface**: On softer surfaces, the ground can also deform slightly under the wheel, adding to rolling resistance.
  
  The formula for rolling resistance is:
  \[
  F_{rolling} = \mu_r \cdot N
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \mu_r \) is the coefficient of rolling resistance (much smaller than the coefficient of static or kinetic friction).
  - \( N \) is the normal force (which can be different on the front and rear wheels).

### Differences Between Static Friction and Rolling Friction:
- **Static friction** is what keeps the wheel from slipping and is necessary for **pure rolling**. It can be quite large, especially when accelerating or braking.
- **Rolling friction** (or rolling resistance) is the force that opposes rolling motion due to deformation and other factors. It is typically much smaller than static friction and is responsible for energy loss as the wheel rolls.

### In the Bicycle Scenario:
- **Static friction** at the rear wheel provides propulsion by preventing backward slipping as the wheel rotates.
- **Rolling friction** opposes the forward motion of the bicycle on both the front and rear wheels, but its effect is much smaller compared to the driving force provided by static friction on the rear wheel.

### Summary:
- **Static friction** ensures the wheels roll without slipping, particularly important for the rear wheel, which uses this friction to propel the bicycle forward.
- **Rolling friction** (or rolling resistance) is a small resistive force that arises due to the deformation of the wheels and the surface, contributing to energy losses as the bicycle moves.

So, while **static friction** is crucial for rolling without slipping, **rolling friction** is a different type of force that deals with energy loss during rolling motion.

by definition, friction force must have velocity of different direction, or tendency of velocity of different direction, what is the velocity difference for rolling friction

You're right in pointing out that friction forces typically arise due to a difference in velocity (or the **tendency** for such a difference) between two surfaces in contact. This is true for both **static** and **kinetic friction**. When it comes to **rolling friction (rolling resistance)**, however, the situation is a bit different because there isn't a direct relative velocity at the point of contact between the wheel and the ground in the case of **pure rolling**.

### Understanding Rolling Friction (Rolling Resistance)

Rolling friction is not caused by a relative velocity between the wheel and the ground, but rather by **deformations** and **internal energy losses** in the materials. Here's the explanation:

1. **No Relative Velocity in Pure Rolling**:
   - In pure rolling motion, the point of contact between the wheel and the ground has zero relative velocity (i.e., the velocity of the contact point on the wheel is exactly zero relative to the ground at the instant of contact). This means **there is no sliding** at the point of contact, and hence no kinetic friction.
   - Therefore, rolling friction does not arise from a velocity difference between the wheel and the ground at the point of contact. Instead, it stems from other mechanical effects, particularly **deformation**.

2. **Deformation and Energy Loss**:
   - **Deformation of the wheel**: As the wheel rolls, the material of the wheel (especially if it's made of rubber, like a tire) deforms at the contact point. This compression of the wheel and its recovery as it rolls cause energy losses, primarily in the form of heat.
   - **Deformation of the surface**: If the surface is soft (like sand or grass), it also deforms where the wheel makes contact, adding to the rolling resistance.
   
   These deformations create a **mismatch between the forces** that act on different parts of the wheel as it rolls. This leads to rolling friction, which opposes the motion even though there’s no relative sliding at the contact point.

3. **Asymmetry in Deformation**:
   - The wheel flattens slightly at the contact point due to the normal force from the ground. Because of this deformation, the normal force acting on the wheel is not symmetric — it's slightly forward of the center of the contact patch. 
   - This creates a small **moment** or torque that resists the rolling motion. The rolling friction results from the force needed to overcome this resistive moment.

4. **Tendency for Velocity Mismatch (Effective)**:
   - While there is no actual relative velocity at the contact point, the **deformation** introduces an effective velocity mismatch between the **leading edge** and **trailing edge** of the wheel at the contact point.
   - On the leading edge of the deformed part, the wheel is "pushing" into the surface, while on the trailing edge, the material is recovering. This asymmetry leads to a rolling resistance that acts similarly to a friction force.

### Analogy to Friction Forces:
Even though rolling friction does not result from relative velocity at the contact point, it behaves like friction in that it:
- **Opposes motion**: Rolling friction acts in the direction opposite to the wheel's motion.
- **Involves energy dissipation**: Just as with friction, rolling friction results in energy loss, typically as heat, due to the internal deformation of the materials.

### Summary of Rolling Friction:
- Rolling friction does not arise from a difference in velocity at the point of contact (as happens in kinetic friction or static friction). Instead, it is due to **energy losses from deformation** of the wheel and the surface.
- There is an effective **velocity mismatch** caused by deformation that leads to energy dissipation and opposes rolling motion, but this mismatch is internal to the materials and not a direct sliding at the contact point.
- **No sliding** occurs in rolling friction, but it still resists motion by dissipating energy through mechanical deformation.

In this way, rolling friction is a fundamentally different kind of resistive force than static or kinetic friction, even though it plays a similar role in opposing the motion of a rolling object.

the different nature of friction in front and real wheel comes from the torque

Yes, the key difference in the nature of friction between the front and rear wheels of a bicycle **comes from the torque** applied to the rear wheel, and not to the front wheel. This torque fundamentally changes how the frictional forces act on each wheel. Let's break down this distinction:

### 1. **Rear Wheel: Torque Drives the Bicycle**
- **Torque Applied**: In a typical bicycle setup, the rider generates torque on the **rear wheel** by pedaling. This torque is transmitted to the rear wheel through the chain and gear system. The applied torque causes the rear wheel to rotate, attempting to push backward against the ground at the point of contact.
  
- **Static Friction for Propulsion**: At the rear wheel's contact point with the ground, **static friction** prevents the wheel from slipping backward. This frictional force acts **forward**, pushing the bicycle forward.
  - The torque applied to the rear wheel creates a tendency for the wheel to spin, but static friction resists this and translates the torque into forward motion.
  - Thus, the frictional force on the rear wheel serves to **propel the bicycle forward**.
  
  This means the rear wheel's static friction is a **driving force** because it works in conjunction with the applied torque to push the bicycle forward.

### 2. **Front Wheel: No Torque, Passive Rolling**
- **No Torque Applied**: Unlike the rear wheel, the **front wheel** does not have any direct torque applied to it in most standard bicycles. It passively rolls along the surface due to the forward motion of the bicycle.
  
- **Static Friction for Rolling**: In the front wheel, static friction acts at the point of contact to ensure that the wheel rolls without slipping, just like the rear wheel. However, because no torque is applied, the role of static friction is purely **to resist any potential slipping**, not to drive the bicycle forward.
  - The friction on the front wheel typically acts **opposite** to the direction of motion, but it is relatively small because it only ensures smooth rolling without contributing to propulsion.

  Therefore, the front wheel’s static friction acts as a **resistive force**, primarily ensuring that the wheel rolls without slipping.

### Why Torque Makes the Difference:
- **Rear Wheel**:
  - Torque applied at the rear wheel creates a tendency for the wheel to rotate backward at the contact point. Static friction resists this, and the result is a **forward force** that propels the bicycle.
  - The friction on the rear wheel plays an **active role** in driving the bicycle because of the torque applied to it.

- **Front Wheel**:
  - No torque is applied to the front wheel. It simply follows the motion of the bicycle, and static friction only ensures that the front wheel rolls without slipping.
  - The friction on the front wheel is **passive** and primarily acts to prevent sliding. It does not help to drive the bicycle forward.

### Summary:
- The **rear wheel** experiences friction that is a result of the torque applied by the pedaling action. This friction acts as a **driving force** and helps propel the bicycle forward.
- The **front wheel** does not have any applied torque, and its friction is simply there to ensure rolling without slipping, making it a **resistive force** rather than a driving one.

In essence, the difference in the frictional forces between the front and rear wheels arises because **torque is applied to the rear wheel** and not the front. This torque makes the rear wheel's friction a propulsive force, while the front wheel's friction remains a passive resistance.

let's go back to the fundamental idea of force, which is the interaction between two object, or f = ma in Newtonian 3rd law. from these two perspective, explain why the torque causes the different friction force in front and rear wheel

Great! Let's dive into the **fundamental ideas** of force and interaction, using both the **Newton's Third Law** and the relationship between **force, mass, and acceleration** (Newton's Second Law) to explain why torque causes different friction forces on the front and rear wheels.

### Newton's Third Law Perspective: Action and Reaction

Newton's Third Law states that **for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction**. This principle plays a key role in understanding the forces acting on both the rear and front wheels.

#### Rear Wheel:
- **Action (Torque on the Rear Wheel)**:
  - The rider applies a **torque** on the rear wheel by pedaling, which attempts to rotate the rear wheel in a clockwise direction (if viewed from the rider's right side).
  - As a result of this torque, the contact point between the rear wheel and the ground exerts a backward force on the ground (this is the action force).
  
- **Reaction (Static Friction Force on the Rear Wheel)**:
  - According to Newton’s Third Law, the ground exerts an equal and opposite reaction force at the contact point.
  - This reaction is the **static friction force** acting **forward** on the rear wheel, which prevents it from slipping backward and instead propels the bicycle forward.
  
  The torque applied by the rider on the rear wheel is transmitted to the ground through this friction force. Without the friction, the rear wheel would just spin in place, and the bike would not move forward.

#### Front Wheel:
- **No Applied Torque**:
  - There is **no direct torque** applied to the front wheel by the rider. The front wheel simply rolls passively along the surface due to the forward motion of the bicycle.
  
- **Interaction Between Front Wheel and Ground (Rolling)**:
  - Since no torque is applied, the only interaction between the front wheel and the ground is through the **normal force** (from the ground) and the **static friction** that ensures the wheel rolls without slipping.
  - The **static friction** on the front wheel resists any tendency for the wheel to slip. In this case, there is no driving force, so the friction is primarily a **resistive force**.

  Essentially, the front wheel is dragged along by the forward motion of the bicycle, and the static friction just ensures smooth rolling, but it doesn't contribute to forward motion.

### Newton’s Second Law Perspective: \( f = ma \)

Newton's Second Law, \( f = ma \), states that the **net force** on an object causes an acceleration proportional to its mass.

#### Rear Wheel (Torque Drives Acceleration):
- **Torque Produces Acceleration**:
  - The torque applied on the rear wheel creates a rotational motion (angular acceleration) in the wheel. This angular acceleration is translated into **linear acceleration** at the contact point between the wheel and the ground.
  - The rear wheel's contact point tries to **slip backward** due to the torque. The ground resists this slipping via static friction, which results in a **forward force**.
  
  The static friction force on the rear wheel is thus the **net force** that propels the bike forward, providing acceleration for the entire system (bike and rider). Mathematically, if \( F_{\text{friction}} \) is the static friction force on the rear wheel, the linear acceleration \( a \) of the bicycle is given by:
  \[
  F_{\text{friction}} = m_{\text{bike}} \cdot a
  \]
  This force is generated because the torque produces a tendency for the wheel to rotate, and static friction stops the slipping by converting this into forward motion.

#### Front Wheel (No Torque, Passive Rolling):
- **No Torque, No Net Force for Acceleration**:
  - Since no torque is applied to the front wheel, there is no **force driving** the front wheel forward.
  - The front wheel rolls passively because it is connected to the frame of the bicycle, which is being propelled forward by the rear wheel.
  
- **Static Friction as a Resistive Force**:
  - The front wheel’s static friction prevents it from slipping, ensuring it rolls smoothly. However, because no torque is applied, the static friction acts purely to resist any relative motion between the wheel and the ground (such as sliding). The force is minimal and is only present to maintain rolling without slipping.

### Key Differences Between Rear and Front Wheels:
1. **Rear Wheel (Driven by Torque)**:
   - Torque causes the rear wheel to push backward on the ground.
   - The ground pushes forward on the rear wheel via static friction, providing the **driving force** that accelerates the bike forward.
   - This friction force is an **active propulsive force** because it translates the applied torque into forward motion.

2. **Front Wheel (No Torque, Passive Rolling)**:
   - No torque is applied to the front wheel, so there is no force to drive it forward.
   - Static friction ensures the front wheel rolls without slipping, but it acts as a **passive resistive force** that does not contribute to propulsion.
   - The front wheel’s friction is small and only serves to prevent sliding.

### Summary:
- **Newton’s Third Law** explains that the frictional forces arise from the interaction between the wheels and the ground. The torque applied to the rear wheel leads to a backward force on the ground, which in turn generates a forward frictional force that propels the bike.
- **Newton’s Second Law** shows that the torque applied to the rear wheel creates a net forward force (through static friction) that accelerates the bike. In contrast, the front wheel has no applied torque and therefore only experiences a passive frictional force to prevent slipping.

Thus, the difference in frictional forces between the front and rear wheels fundamentally arises from the **presence of torque** on the rear wheel and the absence of torque on the front wheel. The torque on the rear wheel leads to a **driving static friction force**, while the front wheel’s static friction is purely **resistive**.

this angular acceleration is the key between rear and front. force exists only if acceleration exisits

Absolutely, angular acceleration is crucial in understanding the difference between the forces on the front and rear wheels of a bicycle. Here’s a breakdown of how angular acceleration links to the forces and friction on each wheel:

### Angular Acceleration and Its Role

1. **Angular Acceleration Defined**:
   - **Angular acceleration (\(\alpha\))** is the rate of change of angular velocity. For a rotating object like a bicycle wheel, it indicates how quickly the wheel’s rotational speed is changing.

2. **Angular Acceleration and the Rear Wheel**:
   - **Torque and Angular Acceleration**: When a rider pedals, torque (\(\tau\)) is applied to the rear wheel, causing it to rotate. This torque leads to an angular acceleration (\(\alpha\)) of the rear wheel.
     \[
     \tau = I \cdot \alpha
     \]
     where \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the wheel.
   - **Friction Force and Propulsion**: The applied torque generates a tendency for the rear wheel to spin. The static friction force at the contact point resists this tendency to spin backward. According to Newton’s Third Law, this friction force is directed forward and provides the **propulsive force** that moves the bicycle forward.
   - **Force-Acceleration Relationship**: The frictional force on the rear wheel is directly related to the angular acceleration. The rear wheel’s angular acceleration causes a linear acceleration of the bicycle, which is given by:
     \[
     F_{\text{friction}} = m_{\text{bike}} \cdot a
     \]
     where \(a\) is the linear acceleration of the bike. This friction force is the result of the torque causing angular acceleration.

3. **Angular Acceleration and the Front Wheel**:
   - **No Applied Torque**: The front wheel does not have any applied torque; it rolls passively without any additional force being applied to change its angular velocity directly.
   - **Static Friction Role**: The front wheel’s static friction ensures that it rolls without slipping but does not drive the bicycle. It counteracts any potential slipping that might occur due to the bicycle's forward motion but does not provide additional propulsion.
   - **Lack of Angular Acceleration Contribution**: Since there is no torque applied to the front wheel, there is no direct angular acceleration generated by the rider. The front wheel’s friction does not contribute to the bicycle’s forward acceleration.

### Summary of Key Points:

- **Rear Wheel**: 
  - **Torque Applied**: The rider’s pedaling creates torque, causing angular acceleration of the rear wheel.
  - **Friction Force**: This torque results in a forward frictional force at the rear wheel’s contact point, which propels the bicycle forward.
  - **Angular Acceleration Impact**: The angular acceleration of the rear wheel is essential for generating the driving force that accelerates the bicycle.

- **Front Wheel**:
  - **No Torque Applied**: The front wheel rotates passively, with no external torque applied directly.
  - **Static Friction Role**: The static friction force on the front wheel only prevents slipping and ensures smooth rolling.
  - **No Angular Acceleration Contribution**: The front wheel’s static friction does not contribute to the bicycle’s forward motion or angular acceleration.

In essence, the **angular acceleration** resulting from the torque applied to the rear wheel is what differentiates the frictional forces on the front and rear wheels. The rear wheel’s angular acceleration leads to a frictional force that drives the bike forward, while the front wheel’s friction is mainly concerned with preventing slipping and does not drive the bicycle.
