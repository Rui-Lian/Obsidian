In the second chapter of "12 Rules for Life," Jordan Peterson emphasizes the importance of self-care by urging individuals to treat themselves with the same care and responsibility they would extend to someone they love, such as a child or a pet. This rule addresses the tendency many people have to prioritize the well-being of others over their own, often neglecting their own needs and health.

## Key Concepts

1. **Self-Loathing and Responsibility**: Peterson discusses how self-loathing can lead individuals to neglect their own needs, often treating themselves worse than they would treat others. He highlights that many people are better at ensuring their pets receive necessary care than they are at caring for themselves, which reflects a deeper issue of self-worth and responsibility。 

1. **Biblical and Psychological Insights**: Drawing from biblical stories and psychological insights, Peterson suggests that understanding how to treat oneself requires recognizing one's own value. He references the story of Adam and Eve to illustrate feelings of shame and inadequacy that can stem from human nature, which may contribute to self-neglect. He argues that individuals must learn to see themselves as deserving of care and support

3. **Practical Steps for Self-Care**: To implement this rule, Peterson encourages individuals to make commitments to themselves, pursue personal goals, and take care of their physical and mental health. He suggests that envisioning a better life for oneself can motivate individuals to overcome obstacles and prioritize their well-being



1. **Rejecting Self-Sacrifice**: Peterson warns against the pitfalls of virtuous self-sacrifice, where individuals suffer silently for the sake of others. He argues that this can lead to resentment and a sense of tyranny, both for oneself and in relationships with others. Instead, he advocates for a balanced approach to caring for oneself and others[](https://www.shortform.com/blog/treat-yourself-like-someone-you-are-responsible-for-helping-jordan-peterson-rule-2/).

In summary, Rule 2 encourages individuals to recognize their own worth and take responsibility for their care, just as they would for someone they love. By treating oneself with kindness and respect, one can foster a healthier and more fulfilling life.
