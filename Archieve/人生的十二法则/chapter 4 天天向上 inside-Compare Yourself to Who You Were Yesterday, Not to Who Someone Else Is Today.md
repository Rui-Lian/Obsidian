To be more than they are today! take small step, but difficult enough to push yourself a little bit. 

停止精神内耗！

靠近知识！每天试着读懂多一些！在基础中间学会思考、思想和逻辑。让自己在考试中赢得自由，不要让考题牵着走！

每一件事情做到crystal clear，讲清楚一件事不容易！设想给自己一遍遍讲清楚！









 your own goals and measuring your progress against your past self, rather than comparing yourself to others. He argues that comparing yourself to others is a recipe for unhappiness and discouragement.

### Comparing Upwards

Peterson notes that people often compare themselves to those who are more successful, attractive, or accomplished than they are. This "comparing upwards" can lead to feelings of inadequacy, envy, and resentment. He uses the example of social media, where people tend to present an idealized version of their lives, leading others to feel bad about their own lives in comparison.

### Comparing Downwards

The opposite of comparing upwards is comparing downwards - looking at those who are less fortunate than you. While this can lead to feelings of gratitude and appreciation for what you have, Peterson cautions against using it as a way to feel better about yourself. He argues that it's important to have empathy for those who are struggling and to try to help them, rather than using their misfortune to make yourself feel superior.

### Measuring Progress

Instead of comparing yourself to others, Peterson suggests measuring your progress against your past self. This means setting your own goals and working towards them, rather than trying to keep up with those around you. He argues that this approach is more likely to lead to genuine happiness and fulfillment, as you are focusing on your own growth and development rather than trying to be someone else.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Chapter 4 encourages readers to focus on their own goals and progress, rather than comparing themselves to others. Peterson argues that this approach is more likely to lead to happiness and fulfillment in the long run.
