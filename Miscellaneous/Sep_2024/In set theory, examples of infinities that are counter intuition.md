In set theory, there are several examples of infinities that defy common intuition. These often come from comparing different sizes of infinite sets and from properties of infinite sets that don’t behave like finite sets. Here are some of the most counterintuitive examples:

### 1. **Hilbert’s Infinite Hotel Paradox (Countable Infinity):**
   Imagine an infinite hotel with countably infinite rooms, each of which is occupied by a guest. At first glance, you might think the hotel is full, but the hotel can still accommodate more guests, even infinitely many.

   - **Scenario 1: Adding one guest**  
     If a new guest arrives, the hotel can move the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on. Room 1 is now free for the new guest, and everyone still has a room.
     
   - **Scenario 2: Adding infinitely many guests**  
     If infinitely many new guests arrive, the hotel can move the guest in room \( n \) to room \( 2n \), doubling the room numbers for existing guests. This frees up all the odd-numbered rooms for the infinitely many new guests.
     
   This is counterintuitive because, in the real world, a "full" hotel wouldn’t be able to accommodate additional guests, let alone an infinite number.

### 2. **There are the Same Number of Even Numbers as Natural Numbers:**
   Intuitively, it seems like the set of even numbers \( \{2, 4, 6, 8, \dots\} \) is smaller than the set of all natural numbers \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\} \), since it’s only a "subset" of the naturals. However, both sets have the same cardinality, \( \aleph_0 \) (countably infinite), because there is a one-to-one correspondence between them. For example, the function \( f(n) = 2n \) maps each natural number \( n \) to a unique even number.

   This defies our intuition, which tells us that a subset should be smaller than the set it comes from, but in the case of infinite sets, they can have the same size.

### 3. **Rational Numbers are Countably Infinite, Even Though They Seem Denser:**
   The rational numbers (fractions of the form \( \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers) appear to form a "dense" set because between any two rational numbers, there is another rational number. Despite this density, the rational numbers are countably infinite and have the same cardinality as the natural numbers.

   You can list all rational numbers using a clever scheme (such as arranging them in a grid and zigzagging through it), demonstrating that they can be matched one-to-one with the natural numbers. The idea that a set can be dense yet still countable is very counterintuitive.

### 4. **The Real Numbers are Uncountably Infinite (Larger than Countable Infinity):**
   The set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \), including all decimal expansions between 0 and 1, is uncountably infinite, meaning it’s a larger infinity than the set of natural numbers \( \mathbb{N} \). Cantor’s famous diagonal argument shows that no matter how you try to list all the real numbers between 0 and 1, you will always miss some, proving that there are more real numbers than natural numbers.

   The counterintuitive part is that both sets are infinite, yet one is "larger" than the other. It’s not immediately obvious that infinities can come in different sizes.

### 5. **Some Intervals of Real Numbers Have the Same Cardinality as the Entire Real Line:**
   Another surprising fact is that the interval \( (0, 1) \) on the real number line has the same cardinality as the entire real number line \( \mathbb{R} \). This means that the set of numbers between 0 and 1 is "just as large" (in terms of cardinality) as the set of all real numbers from negative infinity to positive infinity.

   This seems paradoxical because the interval \( (0, 1) \) is a small part of \( \mathbb{R} \), yet it contains as many numbers as \( \mathbb{R} \) itself. The reason is that there exists a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the two sets.

### 6. **The Power Set of Any Set is Always Larger than the Set Itself:**
   Given any set \( A \), the power set \( \mathcal{P}(A) \) (the set of all subsets of \( A \)) always has a strictly larger cardinality than \( A \) itself. For finite sets, this is intuitive because the power set contains more subsets than there are elements in the original set. However, this also holds for infinite sets.

   For example, if \( A = \mathbb{N} \) (the natural numbers), then the power set \( \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \) has a larger cardinality, \( 2^{\aleph_0} \), which is the cardinality of the continuum \( \mathfrak{c} \). This is counterintuitive because both \( \mathbb{N} \) and \( \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \) are infinite, yet \( \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \) is strictly larger.

### 7. **The Banach–Tarski Paradox (Paradox of Infinite Divisibility):**
   This is a highly counterintuitive result from set theory and geometry. It states that you can take a solid ball, divide it into a finite number of pieces (using abstract, non-measurable cuts), and then reassemble those pieces into two solid balls, each the same size as the original.

   This paradox arises because of the properties of infinite sets and is closely related to the axiom of choice. It defies our everyday experience with physical objects but is perfectly valid in the realm of set theory and infinite structures.

### Summary:
These examples challenge our understanding of infinity because we tend to apply finite intuitions to infinite sets. In the realm of infinite sets, many of the rules that hold for finite sets break down, leading to surprising and counterintuitive results.
