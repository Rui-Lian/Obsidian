no consistent reasoning. 

A turning point to push mathematics to more rigerious point. 

"And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?"


$$
f(x) = x^2
$$

$$
f(x + dx) = (x + dx)^2
$$


$$
f(x + dx) = x^2 + 2x \cdot dx + (dx)^2
$$

$$
\begin{align}
df = f(x + dx) - f(x) &= x^2 + 2x \cdot dx + (dx)^2 - x^2 \\
&= 2x \cdot dx + (dx)^2
\end{align}
$$

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = 2x + \frac{(dx)^2}{dx}
$$

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = 2x
$$

- dx is treated as if it is both **non-zero** (since we divide by dxdxdx to compute the derivative) and **zero** (since we neglect terms like (dx)2(dx)^2(dx)2 because they are "infinitely small").
- Berkeley's critique: How can something be non-zero when it suits us (so we divide by dxdxdx) and zero when it suits us (so we discard $(dx)2(dx)^2(dx)2)$ ? This leads to a contradiction.
## Infinitesimals and more formal Concept of Limits

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
