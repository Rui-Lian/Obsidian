- Be relaxed, don’t be the overwhelmed by your peers, the mark, the results; 
    

- Let your mind go free when you face a problem for some seconds. 
    

- Have the courage and passion and persistency
    
- Use your brain to FEEL the problem. 
    
- Understand your shortcomings and your own difficulties. 
    

- Learn to analyze and develop, instead of use the hammer and screw once for all
    

- Your fixed toolboxes may block your analysis and idea development
    
- You learn more by active engagement rather than passive listening. 
    

- Let your brain to float in the air, to get the big picture perspective
    
- Encourage some deep thinking—even though many threads of thoughts end up with nothing. 
    
- Try to connect some seemly irrelevant ideas, looking old things with new perspectives: 
    

- Link neurons through repeated use; 
    
- Link more neurons together. 
    

- Try to explain to other people and to yourself
    

- Use metaphor and analogy
    
- Use verbal and visual in-between 
    

- Try to vary the perspectives: zoom-in and zoom-out. 
    
-   
    

- Ultimate goal: let your brain to be strong, instead of having a great variety of tools
    

- Possible imbalance of the two modes for an aspiring girl: 
    

- Always ready to follow the rules; 
    

- Loss the chance to be creative: You haven’t exercised your brain until you’ve solve the problem yourself. 
    

- Too much attention on the performance marks; 
    
- Need more confidence—believe in yourself
    
- Overcome all these mental barriers. 
    

  

Procrastination management: 

- Unhappy feeling—avoidance and funnel attention onto a more pleasant task—temporarily feel happy
    
- Such ‘unhappiness’ is transient: [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048076](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048076)
    
- Pomodoro as a tool
    
- Practice and build strong neural connections, an analogue:  
    

- Waiting the motor to dry:

Two memory system: 

- Long term memory: a vast warehouse
    

- Automatic link new ideas with existing items—metaphor, analogue fundations
    
- Spaced repetition: 
    

- Working memory
    

- Immediately and concisously
    
- Prefrontal cortex
    
- Also connected to other parts of brain
    
- It is believed that working memory holds only about four chunks of information
    

- How to connect some big, complex ideas? 
    
- We tend to group memory items into chunks automatically, so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is
    

- Grouping consciously and unconsciously is important
    

- Repetition at least few times (maybe three times) needed to secure working memory
    

- Two types of memories are related
    
- Memory: Human brain is good at visuospatial pattern recognition: 
    

- Use spatial pattern to facilitate memorizing
    

- Millions years ago, our ancestors do not need to read numbers. But but they need to read shape, color, length of woods and remember the path to cave. 
    

- You can remember the shape, arrange of the Forbidden City in one visit.

- Theoretical foundation for data visualization
    

- Build broader brain connections: 
    

- Sound; 
    
- Smell
    

- Spaced repetition is good for learning. 
    

- Anki technique
    

- Memory palace technique
    
- STM, LTM, consolidation, reconsolidation, reactivation
    

- Try to link current with past: STM get more chance to consolidation, LTM get chance to reconsolidation. 
    

  

Chunk: 

- Use logical to connect concepts together and to know what’s really going on. 
    

- Chunk analogues: 
    

- Trees and forest
    
- A jumbled puzzle pieces and a Mona Lisa
    
- Some files and a ZIP file
    
- Many subtle movements and wearing a jacket
    
- The Hanon scale in piano
    

- Creation of concept chunks is the first step towards gaining expertise
    

- Focus and repetition practice helps
    
- Can a gorilla learn to wear a jacket? You use chunk to make some tasks automatic—you don’t need to remember everything detailed. In that sense, just need to understand the most critical, newest, hardest pieces. 
    
- A re-oriented focus on math problem: 
    

- Strong focus on the how the idea/skill are formulated from fundamental pieces. 
    
- Less focus on the step by step. 
    
- Strong focus on the similarity/difference between problems. 
    

- Steps to form chunk: 
    

- Focus
    
- Understand and do it yourself
    
- Gaining context: context is where bottom-up and top-down learning meet. 
    
- Practice makes permanent. 
    

  

Illusions of competence in learning

- Illusions: 
    

- Repeated reading—recall and active retrieve
    

- Reading is more comfortable than recall
    
- Repetition others’ solution is just a illusion
    

- Highlighting and underlining must be done carefully—otherwise it can not only ineffective but also misleading. 
    
- Mindmap is only effective after sufficient recall;
    

- Recall can engage working memory actively; 
    

- Don’t spend too much time on textbook. 
    
- Recall around out of study environment.
    
- Text yourself
    
- Words or notes on the margins to synthesize key ideas. 
    
- You are the key—the solution is yours in the mind.

Motivation: 

- Emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and memory
    

- Emygdala is one of the major centers where cognition and emotions are effective integrated. 
    

- Three systems: 
    

- Acetylcholine
    
- Dopamine
    
- Serotonin
    

  

The value of a library of chunks. 

- Transfer: the leap between seemingly unrelated ideas. 
    
- Puzzle analogue: 
    

- Scattered pieces vs. some chunks
    
- The bigger the chunks, the more easier to see the big picture and finish the task; 
    

- Link unrelated ideas to be creativity
    
- The law of serendipity: Lady lucky favors the one who tries. 
    
- Learn, ask, think, criticize and do

Chunking is related to habit. Habit is energy saver

- Four pieces: 
    

- The cue
    
- Routine
    
- Reward
    
- Belief
    

- Task list to change a habit: 
    

- Key tasks list weekly; 
    
- Break down to daily tasks one day before
    

- Subconscious problem solving could happen!
    

- Intermix different tasks: diffusive and focus
    
- Pomodoro time is process oriented, rather than product oriented; 
    

- Difference: 
    

- Product oriented could be more stressed; 
    
- Loss some subtle interaction between the working items and your brain
    

- Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks
    
- Arrange work to series of small challenges; 
    

- Break down is a life long skill. 
    

- Wrap-up each day: 
    

- What tasks have been achieved and you can forget them; 
    
- What progresses have been made and need further works; 
    
- What have been stucked! 
    

- Eat your frogs first everyday! 
    

  

  

Importance of sleep: 

- Sleep cleans metabolic toxins
    

- Toxins during insomnia and consequence:

- Sleep reactive the conscious areas: prefrontal cortex and helps other areas to talking 
    

  

Procrastination: 

- Don’t feel guilty
    

- Chunking is related to habit. Habit is energy saver
    
- Very nature to have negative feeling when facing something new. 
    
- Focus on process instead of product: 
    

- Process: 25 mins to do something with disciplined break-down 
    

- Study 25 mins to know something
    

- Product: I need to finish the test with quality in 25 mins, more stressful. 
    

- Finish jobs in 25 mins. 
    

- Process is more relaxed 
    

- Four pieces: 
    

- The cue
    
- Routine
    
- Reward
    
- Belief
    

  

  

  

Quotes: 

Brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures. 

  

Your are not the same person you were after a nights’ sleep or even a nap. 

  

I don’t get much out of just going and reading a lot of books. 

  

OCEAN, which stands for openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticisim.

Overlearning is less effective study methods

- Overlearning
    

- Overlearning refers to practicing newly acquired skills beyond the point of initial mastery.
    
- The term is also often used to refer to the pedagogical theory that this form of practice leads to automaticity or other beneficial consequences
    
- Overlearning is automatic, but may be shallow
    
- Overlearning may create undesirable fixed mindsets (Einstellung) that prevent innovative thinking
    

- Interleaving as a more efficient, innovative strategy: 
    

- Interleaving helps the newly learnt chunk to be processed subconsciously and possibly connected with other chunks innovatively.
